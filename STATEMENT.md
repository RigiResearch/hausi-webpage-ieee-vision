## Statement
IEEE is uniquely positioned as a global leader in science, technology, and innovation. IEEE must continue to earn the trust of professionals and provide extensive opportunities for professional networking, career development, and life-long learning. 

With its societies, committees and chapters, IEEE is an outstanding home for professionals, students, and researchers providing leadership, foresight, influence, and direction in best practices, education, and leading-edge research. IEEE must be agile in its operations to champion technically and financially sound services and alliances. To sustain its excellence, IEEE must focus on its financial future, the quality of its core assets, and the needs of its membership. 

With my extensive experience as an IEEE volunteer, and if elected as Division Director representing Computer Society, I would provide valuable guidance for strategies and tactics for effective strategic planning, financial accountability of boards and committees. As an IEEE volunteer, I aim to inspire future generations of engineers and scientists through leadership and contributions in IEEE committees. I am deeply committed to advancing equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) at all IEEE levels.
