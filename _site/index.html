<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Hausi Müller is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Canada. For the past decade, he served as Associate Dean Research for the Faculty of Engineering. With his research group, he collaborates extensively with industry as an international expert in software engineering, adaptive systems, intelligent cyber physical systems, and quantum computing. He published over 250 papers and co-organized many conferences and workshops in these research fields, including Dagstuhl and Shonan Meetings in Germany and Japan on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems (2010), Engineering Autonomic Systems (2013) and Software Engineering for Cyber Physical Systems (2017). He was the founding Director of UVic’s accredited Bachelor of Software Engineering degree program. Müller is a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering. Müller received a BS in electrical engineering from ETH Zürich and MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Rice University. He sings, plays guitar, and enjoys hiking and skiing.</p>

<h1 id="statement">Statement</h1>
<p>IEEE is uniquely positioned as a global leader in science, technology, and innovation. IEEE must continue to earn the trust of professionals and provide extensive opportunities for professional networking, career development, and life-long learning.</p>

<p>With its societies, committees and chapters, IEEE is an outstanding home for professionals, students, and researchers providing leadership, foresight, influence, and direction in best practices, education, and leading-edge research. IEEE must be agile in its operations to champion technically and financially sound services and alliances. To sustain its excellence, IEEE must focus on its financial future, the quality of its core assets, and the needs of its membership.</p>

<p>With my extensive experience as an IEEE volunteer, and if elected as Division Director representing Computer Society, I would provide valuable guidance for strategies and tactics for effective strategic planning, financial accountability of boards and committees. As an IEEE volunteer, I aim to inspire future generations of engineers and scientists through leadership and contributions in IEEE committees. I am deeply committed to advancing equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) at all IEEE levels.</p>
